    title: 'There\'s 5 times as many bull sharks off Alabama now ',
    content: 'Baby bull sharks are showing up way more often in the waters off Alabama, researchers found.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In a study published March 14 in Scientific Reports, researchers found that the number of bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) caught per hour increased five-fold between 2003 and 2020. All the bull sharks captured and released were juveniles, likely because the baby sharks use these sheltered waters to grow and feed.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While bull sharks are among the most aggressive of shark species, beachgoers don\'t need to worry that the increasing presence of these stout-bodied fish will lead to more shark bites, lead author Lindsay Mullins, a fisheries scientist at Mississippi State University, told Live Science. Despite the misconception that sharks hunt humans, "they\'re really not interested in you."\n' +
      '\n' +
      'However, they may prey on some of the animals that get caught in fishing gear, so fishers may notice more of these juvenile bull sharks feeding on their catch, Mullins said.

      'Bull sharks thrive in fresh, brackish and saltwater and can grow to be 11.5 feet (3.5 meters) long. They live in coastal, tropical and subtropical environments, "so they are used to warm waters," Mullins said.\n' +

      'In the new study, scientists reviewed data from the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources\' gillnet survey of the coastline along Mobile Bay. They found 440 bull sharks captured over the study period.',

    content: 'Hundreds of hammerhead sharks gather around an ancient volcano in the Pacific Ocean, drawn by secret signals radiating from the seabed, a new clip reveals.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The footage, which features in the third episode of Netflix\'s new wildlife documentary series "Our Living World," shows a school of hammerhead sharks (Sphyrnidae) circling Cocos Island — a volcanic island in the eastern tropical Pacific about 310 miles (500 kilometers) southwest of mainland Costa Rica.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Cocos Island is a known haven for endangered hammerhead sharks, but scientists still aren\'t sure how and why so many sharks navigate across swathes of ocean to convene there every year.' +
      '"We don\'t really know how these sharks are doing this," Ben Roy, the series producer of Our Living World, told Live Science. "We know that they\'ve got sensors in their heads and we know that these sensors pick up on the magnetic signature of these cool volcanic rocks."\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The island formed when lava erupted from an ancient underwater volcano and solidified, until it eventually rose 12,000 feet (3,660 meters) above the seabed.' +
      'The hammerhead shark gathering is just one astonishing scene among many featured in the four-part nature series, which premieres Wednesday (April 17) on Netflix. The show highlights the intricate links that support the huge web of life on Earth, from the invisible fungal networks that nourish forest ecosystems to transatlantic clouds of nutrients that blow from Africa to South America and rain down on the Amazon' +
      'In telling these stories, "we were really looking for the wow," Roy said. "We are potentially the first generation to be able to fully grasp the connectivity of what\'s going on here and potentially the last generation to be able to put that knowledge to good use."\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The hammerhead shark assembly footage fulfills every expectation Roy had for the show, he said. "Talking about those \'wow\' revelations — for me that was one of them," he said. "Sharks need volcanoes? Who knew!',

      '\n' +
      'In a study published March 8 in the Journal of Fish Biology, scientists confirmed the "atypical" gathering of 12 prickly sharks (Echinorhinus cookei) in the Cordillera de Coiba, Pacific Panama — a 26,000-square-mile (68,000 square kilometers) offshore marine protected area that includes nine mountain ranges, 24 seamounts and a 15,568-foot-deep (4,745 meters) trench.\n' +

      'The elusive prickly sharks, which have bodies covered by thorny, modified teeth, grow up to to 13 feet (4 m) long and may inhabit depths of up to 3,280 feet (1,000 m). "They prefer to be in deeper waters," which makes them difficult to observe, study author Héctor Guzmán, a marine ecologist at Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, told Live Science. Although information on the distribution of this species is scarce, they have been observed from Oregon and Japan in their northerly range down to Chile and New Zealand.\n' +

Before this discovery, there had been no evidence that these sharks aggregated. The researchers aren\'t sure why the sharks were coming together, but it could be to do with feeding. "We saw juvenile hammerheads down there and those are easy targets for the prickly," Guzmán said. It could also be linked to reproduction. The team checked the sharks\' claspers — modified pelvic fins used in reproduction — to confirm that both male and female sharks were at the gatherings.\n' +

    title: 'Smalltooth sawfish in Florida are spinning and beaching themselves',
    content: 'Endangered smalltooth sawfish in Florida are erratically "spinning and whirling" in shallow waters, causing them to strand themselves and die. The "abnormal fish behavior event" currently defies explanation, scientists say.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '"There have been over a hundred unique reports of affected sawfish and now over 30 confirmed mortalities," Adam Brame, the sawfish recovery coordinator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries, told Live Science in an email.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The ongoing mortality event began in October 2023 along the coast of the Florida Keys, and so far 32 smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) have died, although NOAA officials believe that this is an undercount, according to a statement. Deaths have resulted from sawfish "essentially stranding themselves" on beaches, Brame said.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footage posted to Facebook on April 1 shows a smalltooth sawfish spinning near the shore' +
      'Water and tissue samples continue to be tested to discover the cause. The affected sawfish are large juveniles and adults, ranging between 7 and 14 feet (2.1 and 4.2 meters) long.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Historically, smalltooth sawfish lived along the coast of the Americas from the U.S to Brazil, but now they are mainly found in southwestern Florida. The species is critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species — mainly due to overfishing and habitat destruction.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In October 2023, odd swimming behaviors were first reported in small boned fish species in the region. Locals described fish "showing abnormal swimming behaviors in which they erratically swim in circles or swim upside down," Brame said. "We didn\'t get a report of a sawfish that was seemingly affected until late January 2024."\n' +

      'Researchers have examined the dead sawfish but found no signs of contagious disease or bacterial infection that could be responsible, according to a statement from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), which is leading the investigation.',
